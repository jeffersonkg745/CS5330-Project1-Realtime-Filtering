OS/IDE used: iOS, Xcode

Instructions for running executables: Project run in Xcode will need the openCV frameworks/libraries. To run 2 different files (one for the photo in question 1, and one for the video image in question 2-10), two targets were made in Xcode. These can be run independently, but to do so you need to toggle the target selected which is shown at the very top of Xcode before hitting “run”. However, for this assignment only the files will be attached, not the project.

Testing extensions: N/A
